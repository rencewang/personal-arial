      'Inspired by the New Zealand landscape of boundless open grasslands and steep mountains, this 3 story residence is set against the foot of a hill, with a flat pasture in front. The glass facade provides maximum lighting into the residence and guarantees unobstructed view of the outside for anywhere in the house. Combined with the prevalent use of glass, the stone sides present my interpretation of minimalism and modernity. The final illustration is completed in marker and pen.',

      'Telephone poles in the representative shape of cross. In the modern society of digital exchange, has technology become the new god? Construction of the piece involved combination of various textures, such as the smooth marker and plastic, the rough strokes of colored pencils, and the unique, cloud-like foam background. Through presenting the process of fluid shapes morphing into distinct modular buildings, I hope to convey the road from elemental units to advanced civilization, and how the progress towards technology continues to shape our journey.',

Revolving around a tree with blowing spheres, the transient and amorphous water droplets are confined into preset, perfect pear shapes, signifying the limitations imposed by the world and society.

The volumetric shapes are inspired by my experimentation with various fluid forms in Cinema 4D: the digital software’s ability to manipulate glossy textures and to capture bodies in motion sparked my interest in the specific concept. Through this piece, I wanted to show how objects interact with each other and how light and shadow function holistically in a setting.',

The bubbles represent the ephemerality of life, whereas the cage symbolizes the limiting effects of societal preconceptions. The piece seeks to convey the ideas of journey, fluid forms, and freedom that are present in my other works. To complete the piece, I used wood and steel to create the cage and blow-able balloons for the delicateness of the bubbles.',
