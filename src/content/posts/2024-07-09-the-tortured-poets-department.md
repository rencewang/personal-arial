seoDescription: "Album Review: Taylor Swift subverts the iconography that's become her in The Tortured Poets Department. She's resentful and furious, of all the things she's sacrificed to stay on top. She admits to a lot of flaws and mocks her fans. But what makes this album compelling is how honest she is about it all in this genuine sprawl."

Taylor Swift has long been complicit in creating the monstrosity that is obsessed with her, and on _The Tortured Poets Department_, she’s trying to break free. Fame comes with a price, and for Taylor Swift, that price is the demands of fans who feel a parasocial connection to her tales. She’s reaping what she sowed: after all, she’s the one who coalesced her personal narratives into a shared experience for millions. 

But what happens when one’s celebrity grows to engulf one’s humanity? When one’s iconography overshadows one’s freedom? When millions of people feel like they know her enough to claim ownership over her decisions, romantic or otherwise? What is left for her? 

Sure, the album is sprawling with 31 tracks, but I also think it’s brave. She’s not afraid to admit so many things: fantasies about toxic relationships, self-destructive tendencies, avoidant attachment, alcoholism. Her broken parts. She did touch on those insecurities in the past, on folklore and evermore for instance, but as mere narrators of fictional figures. Here, she’s the one experiencing fury and loss. We’re invited into her world, to feel her unvarnished contempt of all the unseen sacrifices she’s made in the process of staying on top for over a decade — it can be cold and lonely atop. 

This world of Taylor Swift is a burning world. She writes about youth and death, one of which she’s hardly relished and the other constantly contemplated. She disses the toxicity of a past partner while romanticizing his presence. She relegates a six-year relationship to jail. She mocks her fans. She’s testing her audience’s limits — seeing how much she can reveal before they turn on her. Asking if one match after another would light the roomful of gasoline ablaze.

For the first time, she doesn’t seem concerned with appearing likable, a tendency pervading much of her discography. People talk about her overexposure over the past years, with chart-topping albums and a world tour and ubiquitous gossip. Maybe she’s sick of it too. Maybe she longs to escape the byproducts of fame, to have a life that’s hers. A world that’s hers. Even if it costs her pristine image, even if it means subverting the iconography that’s become her, even if it requires deconstructing the fame machine from within. The album is a compelling body of work because of how honest she is about it all.

And that is why I can never be an influencer, not actively, at least. Besides my laziness, my slowness (both mentally and productivity-wise), and my belief that turning influencership into a career would deprive me of the simple joy of sharing, there is danger in going public: what you say online stays online. With the limelight comes scrutiny. The weaknesses you reveal can and will be used against you. It’s a permanent and irreversible process. I don’t want to be shackled by my persona. 

Then again, it’s not like I’ll ever be famous like Taylor Swift. My talents are scant anyway. With all peace and love, no one would care about a nobody like me. The world is bigger than me, and I’m shielded by others’ apathy. So I still chose to make my writing, projects, and profiles public because what is life without risks? I’ve learned to care less — because no one else does. I learned that everybody moves on, and that one person’s cringe doesn’t really mean anything.

A dear friend once said he wants to create things that will outlast him. I used to laugh because I believe that sooner or later, everything goes. Since then, I’ve realized I, too, still want to create, but not necessarily for them to outlast me. It’s a creator economy out there. Building a personal brand is important with the impending AI doom (which I don’t think I’ll live long enough to see but alas, miracles do occur). We need something to hinge our identity on, if not the blockchain (LOL).

Furthermore, creating and publicizing is part of the metaphysical quest to prove my existence beyond myself by impacting an unknown world. Now, maybe it’s a mental illness to engage in self-revisionism, but I kind of enjoy living double lives and smearing the boundary between fiction and nonfiction, between my inner and outer voices. They only know what you let them see, people say. With certain contexts removed, whatever I display **is** the truth, and that’s the power trip. 

I’ve also started to wonder if I create to be understood. “In the end, better than anything is being understood,” I read in _Pitchfork_’s review of _the record_. Understanding is a dangerous thing for a man to seek, so I typically avoid thinking of myself as such. Yet for all the smoke and mirrors I deploy, I can’t ignore my heart’s palpitations when I was decoded that one late night in San Francisco when I was FaceTiming and eating dinner at 3:34 am.

At the end of the day, I’d like to stay as someone who creates for himself. I don’t want to be changed by publicity — there is danger in catering to an audience, no matter how innocuous-seeming, as Taylor Swift demonstrates. She used to care about how she’s perceived and how relatable her image was. But in _The Tortured Poets Department_, she’s creating for herself. Indeed, for a creator, the process of creation should be enough justification for the product. Just like life, the journey alone justifies the end. 

There’s a Chinese saying that to be perceived is to be misunderstood. It takes training to accept that, and I’m on it (for now it involves whispering to myself in the mirror “you got me misunderstood, but at least I look this good”). No one seems to believe me when I say I’m an open book. but I think they’re just confusing being an open book with being nonfiction. I never said I was a nonfiction open book! 

I want to control my narrative but let go of the interpretation. I want to only care about having created and released, but leave the interpretation to the world, to the spectators. “This is the part where I spit it all out, and you decide what you think of me,” I’d say. I want to craft who I am, but not be the arbiter of what I can be. 

So I need not be relatable. It’s fine if only few understand. But somehow I’m sure, no matter what, someone will. Dear reader, aren’t you still reading.  

In the song FoolMoon wrote for his 23rd birthday, he sings:  

> 那时流行什么东西 (What was once in style)  
> 现在恐怕还是一样 (Probably is still that way)  
> 但你看我还是做我想做的 (But you see, I’ve been doing what I wanted)  
> 此刻也能被你播放 (And you’re still playing this song today)  

I’m 23 too. I hope that will be the case for me too. I pour out pages of myself, in the form of images or texts or videos, and put them online. So that I live on as an open book. So that the book’s pages can fly somewhere I can’t physically be, and touch someone far, far away. 

Creating is an outlet. Not a performance. Art is personal. It can be a private view. Such is what I’ve believed, and so I think is the case for _The Tortured Poets Department_. Even if the album is of no value to anyone else, writing was a lifeline for Taylor. Meet someone, kiss someone. Love someone, lose someone. How do we record history for our future self? How do we project from now into eternity? How do we preserve the vibrations of emotions through time? What can we do but pen it all down.
