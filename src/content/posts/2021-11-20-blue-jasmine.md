I had wanted to write something about _Blue Jasmine_ for a while, but was never sure how to put my thoughts into words — maybe it’s because for all her crazy and flaws, a part of her reminds me of my once (and perhaps still) ambitious self. The contrast between the elegant and prideful Jasmine and the wet-haired, shattered but still Chanel-wearing Jasmine after her pride crumbles is a cautionary tale. Ambition motivates us to reach higher, the race encourages us to climb faster — to want to become "something substantial" is no crime. Pride, whether as a precondition for or byproduct of ambition, requires a stable source in the form of wealth, status, or mindset. For Jasmine, losing the source of her pride destorys her, yet the lingering pride stops her from reclaiming herself.

Jasmine wasn't always a delicate and elegant jasmine. But she thought she deserves something substantial, so she changed her name and then, step by step, crafted the life she had. “You can’t always blame everything on your genes. If you’re prepared to work hard, and not settle…” says Jasmine as she lectures her sister on the secret to success. I agree to a certain extent, but I don’t think she’s completely correct. In reality, preparing to work hard and not settle is not enough; trying is not enough; even if you put in hard work you still might not succeed. Not to sound Oscar Wilde-ish but everyone works hard these days. To succeed you need luck, you need acumen to capitalize on opportunities.

One of Jasmine’s problems is how she overplays her own contribution in her rags-to-riches story and neglects the role of luck. Anyone can reinvent themselves to be a Jasmine, but not all of them could have been courted by a businessman — that’s her luck. That miscalculation of luck leads to a mismatch between Jasmine's pride and her abilities. Concealing herself behind pride does not make one worthy — Jasmine is still fragile at her core.

She does not realize how fragile her source of pride is — it all comes down to her husband. When designing her persona, she only builds the walls of pride and roof of ambition, but forgets a foundation grounded on self-sufficiency. She mistakes being a trophy wife for being the trophy. To support Jasmine’s pride and ambitions, being a beautiful fool is not enough. Substance and skills are also required. In their absence, nothing can support her elegant but hollow frame. 

As the story unfolds, pride is all that Jasmine has left. Her lonesome, pathetic pride. She already lost her money, her status, her son. If she forgoes pride she will be nothing. And she can't bear being nothing. When she almost succeeds at reinvention, her pride stops her. She refuses advances by her sister’s friends as well as the dentist — they are clearly beneath her. Had her pride not driven her to lie to the diplomat about her past, maybe they'd have gotten married. 

There are plenty of valid criticisms of Jasmine: didn’t she ask for this? Didn’t she report her husband, and thus debased her pride in a moment’s rage? Didn't she treat her sister poorly? Yes, she did. But I still don’t want to criticize her too harshly because I see a bit of myself in her. A combination of stupidity and pride led to her downfall, and who's to say that mine won’t? Maybe until then.

I wonder, how ought I live, should I be stripped of what I pride myself on? How ought I live, should I be prideful, ambitious, but ruined at the same time? There are several things I can think of. Prevent the loss of the most intrinsic parts of my personality by grounding it in skills that I practice and hone and potentially excel in. Have a consistent mindset that self-resolves incongruencies, that weighs pride against ambitions and ability. Finally, don’t forget that “the harder working the luckier.” Putting in hard work means being better prepared for opportunities, which roughly equates to being luckier, if you can ignore my poor math.

That’s what _Blue Jasmine_ is to me: a warning about the dangers in the pursuit for something substantial. Jasmine’s ambition and unwillingness to settle distinguished her, but also led to her downfall. I don’t know whether she can reconcile wanting more and being less than more. I don't know if she will climb out of her sister’s San Francisco apartment and the dentist reception desk and interior design classes. But I hope she does.
