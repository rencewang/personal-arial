I had wanted to write something about _Blue Jasmine_ for a while, but was never sure how to put my thoughts into words — maybe it’s because for all her crazy and flaws, a part of her reminds me of my once (and perhaps still) ambitious self. The contrast between the elegant and prideful Jasmine and the wet-haired, shattered but still Chanel-wearing Jasmine after her pride crumbles is a cautionary tale. Ambition motivates us to reach higher, the race encourages us to climb faster — to want to become "something substantial" is no crime. Pride, whether as a precondition for or byproduct of ambition, requires a stable source in the form of wealth, status, or mindset. For Jasmine, the loss of pride beats her down, yet the presence of pride stops her from reclaiming herself.

Jasmine wasn't always a delicate and elegant jasmine. But she thought she deserves something substantial, so she changed her name and then, step by step, crafted the life she had. “You can’t always blame everything on your genes. If you’re prepared to work hard, and not settle…” says Jasmine as she lectures her sister on the secret to success. I agree to a certain extent, but I don’t think she’s completely correct. In reality, preparing to work hard and not settle is not enough; trying is not enough; even if you put in hard work you still might not succeed. Not to sound Oscar Wilde-ish but everyone works hard these days. To succeed you need luck, you need acumen to capitalize on opportunities.

So one of Jasmine’s problems is how she overplays her own contribution in her rags-to-riches story and neglects the role of luck. Anyone can reinvent themselves to be a Jasmine, but not all of them would have been courted by a businessman — that’s her luck. As for pride, sometimes it's beneficial just like confidence, but it fails Jasmine because of the mismatch between her pride and her abilities due to her miscalculation of luck. Concealing herself behind layers of pride does not make one worthy — Jasmine is still fragile at her core.

The other part of Jasmine’s problem is not recognizing that she’s fragile in her pursuit for something substantial. Her sources for pride are shaky, too easily reversible. When crafting her persona, she only built the walls of pride and roof of ambition, but forgot a foundation grounded on internal peace and self-consistency. She mistook being a trophy wife for being the trophy. To support Jasmine’s pride and ambitions, being a beautiful fool is not enough. Substance and skills are also important. That’s why the loss of pride beats her down, because with her status peeled away, nothing is left to support her elegant but hollow frame. Thus, she babbles to a stranger on the plane and tells two kids: “well you must have heard of Prozac and lithium.”

When she almost succeeded at reinvention, her pride stepped in to stop her. Her lingering pride meant that advances by her sister’s friends as well as the dentist were perceived as beneath her. Later, had her pride not gotten the better of her, maybe she would not have lied to the diplomat about her past, and then she might have been accepted again as a suitable trophy. In the end, there is plenty of plausible criticism of Jasmine: didn’t she ask for this? Didn’t she report her husband, and thus ruins the base of her pride, in a moment’s rage? Didn't she treat her sister poorly? Yes to all of the above, but I still don’t want to criticize her too harshly because I see a resemblance of myself in her. A combination of her stupidity and pride led to her downfall, and who said that mine won’t lead to my downfall someday? Maybe until then.

Come to think of it, as the story unfolds, we realize that all that Jasmine has left is her pride. Her lonesome, pathetic pride. Her pride that contributed to her destitution — but there’s nothing else for her to cling on to. She has already lost her money, her status, her son, so if she forgoes her pride she will be nothing. She cannot bear such a life. Which leads me to wonder, how ought I live, should I be stripped of what I pride myself on or the pillar of my personality? How ought I live, should I be prideful, lost, and ambitious at the same time?

I think it comes down to two things: prevention and mindset. Prevent the loss of the most intrinsic parts of my personality by grounding it in skills that I practice and hone and potentially excel at. Have a consistent mindset that self-resolves incongruencies, that weighs pride against ambitions and ability. Finally, don’t forget that “the harder working the luckier.” Having put in the hard work means being better prepared for chance occurrences, for slips in the wheel of fortune, which, when aggregated, roughly equals to being luckier.

That’s what _Blue Jasmine_ is to me: it reminds me of what I’d wanted to be in life and the life I’d wanted to live. But it also warns against the dangers in the pursuit for something substantial and how it could govern one’s thinking. Jasmine’s ambition and unwillingness to settle distinguish her, but also partly resulted in her downfall. I don’t know whether she would be able to reconcile wanting more and being less than more, and climb out of her sister’s San Francisco apartment and dentist reception desks and interior design classes, but I hope she makes it.
