I started picking at the mochi mignardise after the waiter refilled my cup for the third time because I couldn’t bear the awkwardness. I was the only table of one in the highest restaurant hovering above Hong Kong. My stomach couldn’t fit another bite — a misfortune that often accompanies my visits to fine dining establishments. The awkwardness should have been within my tolerance, though. Usually, I find isolation comforting. All those late nights stretching into 5 a.m., I thought I was savoring solitude in the absence of sound. _As someone who has a why, I should be able to bear any how_.

I was in Hong Kong alone. I made plans to see a high school friend in Guangzhou, a city I hadn’t seen in twelve years. Last time was mere weeks after learning we’d be moving to America. That trip feels like a dream now, revisiting it in my head. The stickiness of the air clinging to my skin, laced with car exhaust and summer dust. Emerging from the subway stop at Zhujiang Xincheng, there was a world to behold. It was my first time being excused from school for a trip, albeit a business trip. But even an interview at the American Embassy was exciting at eleven.

My last Hong Kong trip was much more recent. I was there as part of my grand Asia tour after college with a friend and an ex. That’s when I fell in love with the city, its aesthetic chaos and cultural pulse. This time, I was fully alone.

I used to be convinced I could live that way forever. All I needed was to commune freely with the universe: through music, words, and fantasy. I didn’t need someone’s embrace. I had proof, too. The rain drenching my luggage as I hauled them up the New York subway platforms. Fireworks lighting up the empty Roman streets on New Year’s Eve exactly as a teenager shouted _Buon Anno_, sparks trembling on his eyelashes with pyro’s bursts. The horizon consuming the sun as I watched from my balcony on the beach of Seminyak. In those lonely moments, I felt invincible.

But when gazing at the shimmering Victoria Harbor from the 102nd floor, tiny vessels dotting the big, big world, the solitude was strange. I couldn’t stop thinking: Wouldn’t it be nice to have a witness? Someone to share this with?

The idea of eternity always fascinated me. But we are fickle beings after all. We romanticize what we don’t have or no longer have. The only paradise is paradise lost. I tried to do everything myself because I was young and proud. Because solitude felt precious and chosen in college, where people and plans were omnipresent whether I wanted them or not. I relished being different, standing alone as the other. But at 24, as collegiate memories fade, companionship suddenly seems appealing.

“Better than anything is being understood,” Pitchfork writes in its review of _the record_ by boygenius. But I feared being defeated by those comfortable moments — by validation from someone, by the warmth of touch, by a dinner waiting for me after work. Needing someone was a concession. Dependence compromised ambition. Softened edges and made you weak.

So I built my monastery, stone by stone, until the walls were high enough to block out the storm; likewise, the sun. I told myself this was strength: to prove I needed no one. But strength is undefined in the absence of vulnerability. To let someone in is not to lose yourself but to expand the boundaries of who you know yourself to be. You’re inviting a light to pour through.

I don’t have to live in extremes. I don’t have to take on the world alone. It’s okay to depend on others, to say, _I am worthy of being held_. It’s okay to choose the easier path. To surrender to comfort, even if it’s temporary. Especially because it’s temporary.

I grew up loved, I believe. Even if my parents didn’t always understand me, even if my friends sometimes misjudged me. For the vast majority of my life, I’ve been fortunate to meet genuine, good people. That’s what made me nostalgic. Last winter, I reorganized my drawer of memorabilia when packing up my room: faded cards, Christmas ornaments sent as gifts, co-authored poems from elementary school when we were bored out of our minds. My family is moving away from SoCal soon. There will continue to be fewer and fewer people on the road. But I still look to these marks of permanence left lingering, even as everything silently changes, as proof of the ephemeral, as reminders that there’s some cosmic logic to life, that I’ve been loved.

You can’t return to sixteen or twenty; I’ll never be 23 again. Youthful tremors only belong to those youthful years. Some experiences only belong to certain iterations of ourselves. I can revisit the rain-slicked nights in New York, the ancient cobblestones of Rome, the sunset beaches in Bali — but never with the same mind that first witnessed them. Never with the same appreciation for that intense, conscious, elected loneliness. And I’ll never return to this moment, this birthday, with this courage to admit that there might be beauty beyond the bounds of independence and solitude.

It’s the mindset that matters. You can chase the feeling, but you‘ll never again be wandering in youth, no matter how many times you buy osmanthus flowers and raise your glass. I cross every part of my fingers, but who am I to think that I’m different? That there would be an everlasting? Maybe I secretly know the right answer, or maybe I’ll choke on my words. Maybe there won’t be an answer, or maybe I’m both the one asking the question and the one who has to eventually answer it. In thirty years I’ll be struck by that bullet I fired twelve years ago. But what makes it romantic is exactly that it’s unknown.

Maybe it’s time to love again.
